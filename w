# Albert Einstein: The Genius of the 20th Century
*A Journey Through His Life and Achievements*

## Introduction
- One of the greatest minds in history, Albert Einstein was a physicist renowned for his contribution to the theory of relativity.
- Born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, in the Kingdom of Württemberg in the German Empire.
- Son of Hermann Einstein, a salesman and engineer, and Pauline Koch.
- Einstein had three children from his marriage to Mileva Marić: Lieserl (born 1902, fate unknown), Hans Albert (born 1904, became a hydraulic engineer), and Eduard 'Tete' (born 1910, diagnosed with schizophrenia as a young adult).

## Early Life and Education
- Einstein attended the Luitpold Gymnasium in Munich, where he first began his education.
- He later moved to Switzerland, where he graduated from the Polytechnic Institute in Zurich in 1900, majoring in physics and mathematics.

## Achievements
- Einstein is most famous for developing the theory of relativity, a groundbreaking work that formed a core of modern physics.
- His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc^2, dubbed 'the world's most famous equation', revolutionized the scientific understanding of energy.
- In 1921, Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect, a cornerstone in the evolution of quantum theory.

## Residences
- Einstein's life took him to several cities across the globe.
- Born in Ulm, Germany, he moved to Munich as an infant. His studies took him to Zurich, Switzerland. His academic career spanned across Prague, Czech Republic, and Berlin, Germany. Fleeing the Nazi regime, he finally settled in Princeton, New Jersey, in the United States in 1933.

## Death
- Einstein passed away on April 18, 1955, at the age of 76, in Princeton, New Jersey, U.S. His legacy, however, continues to live on and inspire generations.

## The Iconic Photo
- This iconic photo, taken on Einstein's 72nd birthday in 1951 by Arthur Sasse, captures the physicist's playful nature. Tired of smiling for pictures, Einstein stuck out his tongue instead, resulting in one of the most memorable images of him.

## Conclusion
- From his humble beginnings to his groundbreaking theories, Albert Einstein's life was a testament to his genius. His contributions to science continue to shape our understanding of the universe.
- Einstein's enduring impact extends beyond science, influencing culture and symbolizing the pursuit of knowledge.
